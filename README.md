# Matlab-Practice-codes
# MATLAB Code Collection  

This repository contains various MATLAB scripts solving different mathematical problems. However, most of the files are not properly named and do not explicitly contain the problem statements.  

## ðŸ”¹ About the Repository  
- The codes in this repository are solutions to a variety of mathematical and computational problems.  
- Since the file names and code comments may not specify the problem statements, users may need to analyze the logic to understand the intended question.  

## ðŸ”¹ How to Identify the Problem Statement?  
If you want to find out what a particular code is solving, you can use the following prompt in ChatGPT:  

### **ðŸ”¹ Suggested Prompt:**  
*"Analyze the following MATLAB code and generate a possible mathematical question or problem statement that the code is solving. Explain the approach briefly."*  

Simply copy and paste the script into ChatGPT with this prompt, and it will generate a possible question that the code is solving.  

## ðŸ”¹ Contributions  
Feel free to rename files properly or add missing problem statements as comments in the scripts. Any contributions are welcome!
